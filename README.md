## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📊 Graph-Guided, LLM-Steered Robust Portfolio Optimization (2025)  
*Python, PyTorch Geometric, Transformers, FinBERT, NumPy, Optuna, Matplotlib*  
Built an intelligent portfolio optimization system combining **LLMs**, **Graph Neural Networks**, and **meta-heuristic algorithms** to model market sentiment and inter-asset dependencies. Integrated LLM-derived expected returns with GNN-based asset relationships and a hybrid optimizer using **Simple Human Learning Optimization (SHLO)** and **Hill Climbing** to balance risk and reward. Implemented robust optimization and explainability layers, achieving improved **Sharpe ratio** and resilience versus classical models on **S&P-100** data.
